This Project uses knowledge distillation, a technique in which a large, complex model (the "Teacher") trains a smaller, simpler model (the "Student") to replicate its performance. The goal is to compress the knowledge from the teacher model into the student model, so the student can achieve similar accuracy but with reduced computational requirements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Teacher-Student Setup: The teacher model is trained beforehand and performs well but is computationally heavy. The student model, a smaller network, is designed to mimic the teacher’s performance with fewer parameters.

Knowledge Distillation Loss: During training, the student learns in two ways:

Imitating the Teacher’s Output: The algorithm computes a soft version of the teacher's output (its class probabilities) at a high "temperature" (a scaling factor applied to soften the outputs). This helps the student learn finer details about how the teacher distributes probabilities across classes, which can capture more nuanced patterns than hard labels alone.
Matching Labels: The student also learns from the original labeled data using standard cross-entropy loss.
Training Process: The algorithm iterates through the dataset, where each sample is fed through both models. The student’s predictions are compared to both the teacher's soft outputs and the true labels, and an optimizer adjusts the student model’s weights to minimize the combined loss.

Accuracy and Adaptation: Over training epochs, a learning rate scheduler gradually reduces the learning rate to fine-tune the student model. The algorithm measures accuracy to monitor how well the student approximates the teacher’s performance.

The result is a distilled student model that achieves high accuracy while being much more efficient, making it suitable for scenarios where computational resources are limited.
